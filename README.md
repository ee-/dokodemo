# `Dokodemo - A Workers Remote Proxy`

A simple implementation of Cloudflare worker reverse proxy project.

## 🔋 Getting Started

This project is meant to be used with [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler). If you are not already familiar with the tool, we recommend that you install the tool and configure it to work with your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com). Documentation can be found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/).

### 👩 💻 Developing

[`src/index.js`](./src/index.ts) calls the request handler in [`src/handler.ts`](./src/handler.ts), and will return the [request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/method) for the given request.

### 🧪 Testing

This template comes with mocha tests which simply test that the request handler can handle each request method. `npm test` will run your tests.

### ✏️ Formatting

This template uses [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) to format the project. To invoke, run `npm run format`.

### 👀 Previewing and Publishing
